# --Predict Moblie App Success--

#### It is a Machine Learning Project that can predict Mobile app success.

##### - There are two milestones to predict if the app will gain succes depend on some features:
- Milestone1: Regression
- Milestone2: Classification

##### Preprocessing Techniques used:
 1. One-Hot-Encoding
 2. Remove Columns
 3. Remove Rows
 4. Dealing with signs and numbers

##### Milestone1 (Regresion):
###### Regression Techniques:
  1. Multiple linear regression.
  2. Polynomial regression. (with polynomial degree = 4)
  3. Lasso regression. (with alpha = 0.1)

##### Milestone 2: Classification
###### Classification Techinques:
  1. Logistic Regression model
  2. SVM model
  3. KNN model
  4. Decision Tree Classifier model
